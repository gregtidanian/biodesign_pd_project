# biodesign_pd_project
A self proposed university project required me to look into unmet clinical needs and concluding my research I decided to design, programme and manufacture a hip worn device to help manage a symptom of Parkinson's Disease known as Freezing of Gait.  The device works by alerting the user experiencing Freezing of Gait (FoG) with a red light, drawing their attention to it and when the user confirms that they're experiencing FoG by tapping on the device, it deploys pre-selected sensory cues (either a pulsing sound or a flashing light).  When the user begins to walk, the device detects the motion and stops the cue. As well as this, it lights amber during the transition between a stationary gait condition and walking, and green when walking is detected.
